## Rules
1. PacSnake begins with a tail length of 5.
2. Ghosts "chase" PacSnake.
3. If PacSnake's head collides with a ghost, wall, or its own body the game is over.
4. In the middle of the map is a white box where the ghosts spawn.
5. Ghosts can freely move through the white box walls, however PacSnake cannot.
6. PacSnake can move through the top and side exits and appear on the opposite exit, however ghosts cannot.
7. Yellow, round food will appear on the map that PacSnake can eat and after a certain period respawns.
8. A PowerUp appears regularly that once eaten can turn PacSnake and the Ghosts blue and enable PacSnake to eat them.
9. Eating a PowerUp will cause the Ghosts to flee from PacSnake.
10. PacSnake's tail will extend by 1 once PacSnake eats a certain amount of food or a single Ghost.
11. The Game gets harder as the score increases.
12. There is a scoreboard that keeps score for you.
